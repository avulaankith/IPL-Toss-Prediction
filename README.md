# IPL Toss Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains the necessary files and Jupyter Notebook (`dscfirst.ipynb`) to predict the toss for IPL matches using machine learning techniques based on historical IPL data.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the outcome of the coin toss in IPL matches. The Notebook (`dscfirst.ipynb`) within this repository demonstrates the process of data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation for toss prediction.

## Folder Structure

- **dscfirst.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code and steps for toss prediction.
- **samplesubmission.csv**: Sample submission file format for predictions.
- **test.csv**: Dataset containing test data for model evaluation.
- **train.csv**: Dataset containing historical IPL data for model training.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl20-dream11.git```
2. **Navigate to Repository Directory**:Access the repository directory:

    Copy code
    ```cd ipl20-dream11```
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:Launch and run the dscfirst.ipynb Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```jupyter notebook dscfirst.ipynb```
4. **Notebook Usage**
    Follow the instructions and comments within the Notebook to understand the analysis, preprocessing, model building, and prediction process.
